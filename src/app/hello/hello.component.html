<h1 mat-dialog-title>üë®‚Äçüíª Welcome to Hacker Breakout!</h1>

<mat-dialog-content>
  <p>
    You are trapped in a world, where cyber technology is heavily advanced. Everything is controlled by an A.I.
    It won't let you leave, so all you can do is compete with others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Everytime you break all walls, you open a door to a new level with higher security and bigger firewall,
    therefore you will need higher network speeds. The packet will move faster based on the level you are in.
    You only have 3 lives, but you gain a life after levelling up.
  </p>
  <p>
    Move the bouncer (paddle) with ‚¨ÖÔ∏è and ‚û°Ô∏è keys on your keyboard. You can check leaderboards by clicking
    on the ‚≠ê button on the far left.
  </p>
  <p>
    One more thing: I will need your name.
