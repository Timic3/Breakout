# Hacker Breakout
Hacking themed Breakout game for school built using Angular framework. Written in Typescript, SCSS and HTML5.

## Backstory
You are trapped in a world, where cyber technology is heavily advanced. Everything is controlled by an A.I.
It won't let you leave, so all you can do is compete with others.

Everytime you break all walls, you open a door to a new level with higher security and bigger firewall,
therefore you will need higher network speeds. The packet will move faster based on the level you are in.
You only have 3 lives, but you gain a life after levelling up.

Move the bouncer (paddle) with ⬅️ and ➡️ keys on your keyboard. You can check leaderboards by clicking
on the ⭐ button on the far left. Score is based on how many firewalls you destroy.
